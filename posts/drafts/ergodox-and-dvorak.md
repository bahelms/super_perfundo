Ergodox EZ and Dvorak: A typing odyssey

I got one of the most customizable keyboards around and decided, "What the hell, let's switch typing layouts entirely."
This is my story.

### The Problem

About six months ago my left wrist began to hurt. I assumed it was due to typing ~8 hours a day for many years.
It seemed to stem from the many sideways movements my left pinky needed to make to hit Shift, Control, Tab, and Escape (yes, I remapped Caps Lock).
Plus there are some awkward key combinations, and the left hand generally does more work than the right.

I stand at my desk all day while working, so my hands hover over the board with only my fingertips making any contact.
This prevents any strain you would get from bending your wrists to rest them on the desk, a nice perk of standing. 
However, there were adjustments I could still make.
I moved the board farther away from my body, and put the right side on a book to
create an incline for my left hand. This allowed that hand to act more naturally, 
which helped a bit but not completely.

My manager recommended exercising my wrists with a [spinner](https://nsdspinner.com/){:target="x"} and
doing [daily stretches](https://youtu.be/mSZWSQSSEjE){:target="x"}.
After incorporating all these remedies, that sometimes dull, sometimes sharp ache persisted. 
I decided to take the nuclear option.

### Enter Ergodox EZ

I've been a big fan of mechanical keyboards since I got my first programming gig, and
I fondly remember pulling the key caps off of those loud original boards in grade school computer class.
There are a few in my collection these days, and I always enjoyed discoverying new, sleek, innovative designs.
I had been drooling over the idea of a customizable split keyboard for some time, even before the wrist pain.
Whenever the time came when my wife would condone yet another board for an even more ridiculous price, I would get one.
This would be the dream board; the board to rule all boards! 
It would sit wherever my individual hands told it to and do whatever my fingers desired.
I had narrowed it down to two options: Keyboardio and Ergodox EZ.


### Enter Dvorak
