Ergodox EZ and Dvorak: A typing odyssey

I got one of the most customizable keyboards around and decided, "What the hell, let's switch typing layouts entirely."
This is my story.

### The Problem

About six months ago my left wrist began to hurt. I assumed it was due to typing ~8 hours a day for many years.
It seemed to stem from the many sideways movements my left pinky needed to make to hit Shift, Control, Tab, and Escape (yes, I remapped Caps Lock, all hail Vim).
Plus there are some awkward key combinations, and the left hand generally does more work than the right.

I stand at my desk all day while working, so my hands hover over the board with only my fingertips making any contact.
This prevents any strain you would get from bending your wrists to rest them on the desk, a nice perk of standing. 
However, there were adjustments I could still make.
I moved the board farther away from my body, and put the right side on a book to
create an incline for my left hand. This allowed that hand to act more naturally, 
which helped a bit but not completely.

My manager recommended exercising my wrists with a [spinner](https://nsdspinner.com/){:target="x"} and
doing [daily stretches](https://youtu.be/mSZWSQSSEjE){:target="x"}.
After incorporating all these remedies, that sometimes dull, sometimes sharp ache persisted. 
I decided to take the nuclear option.

### Enter Ergodox EZ

I've always been a fan of mechanical keyboards.
I fondly remember pulling the key caps off of those old loud boards in computer class.
There are a few in my collection these days, and I always enjoyed discoverying new, sleek, innovative designs.
I had been drooling over the idea of a customizable split keyboard for some time, even before the wrist pain.
Whenever the time came when my wife would condone yet another board for an even more ridiculous price, I would get one.
This would be the dream board; the board to rule all other boards! 
It would sit wherever my hands wished and do whatever my fingers desired.

Of all the options available today, the [Ergodox EZ](https://ergodox-ez.com/){:target="x"}
seems to be the best split mechanical keyboard with the smallest barrier of entry (unless you have the time to build your own).
The ergonomics gained with this board are incredible.
The separate sides sit underneath your hands, wherever that may be.
The optional tilt kit accomodates the natural angle of your wrists.
The keys are in staggered linear columns. 
This takes some getting used to but feels great once you do.
Why are all keyboards not ortholinear?
Each thumb has its own group of keys, allowing them take away a lot of work from tired pinkies.

And the best part? Each key on the board can be programmed to do whatever you want it to!
This brings ultimate customizability.
But be prepared to make constant changes for a long time.
I spent a solid five weeks in flux before mostly settling on my current layout.
This is made possible by how easy it is to change config with the GUI web app.

You can set up to 32 layers, which means at the push of a button all the keys will change to whatever you've set for that layer.
You can also give layers their own backlight color or change it for individual keys.
Options exist to have a single key perform a combination of keypresses or do one thing with a single press and another when held down.
I'm only using two layers currently, one for main and the other to hold all the common symbols used for coding.
I can switch between letters and symbols without leaving the home row. :O
