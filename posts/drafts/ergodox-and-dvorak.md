I got one of the most customizable keyboards around and decided, "What the hell, let's switch typing layouts entirely."
This is my story.

### The Problem

About six months ago my left wrist began to hurt. I assumed it was due to typing ~9 hours a day for many years.
It mostly seemed to stem from so many sideways movements that my left pinky needed to make to hit Shift and Control.
Plus there are some awkward key combinations, and the left hand generally does more work than the right.

I stand at my desk all day while working, so my hands hover over the board which 
prevents any strain you would get from bending your wrists to rest them on the desk,
which is one perk of standing. However, there adjustments I could still make.
I moved the board farther away from my body, and put the right side on a book to
create an incline for my left hand. This allowed that hand to act more naturally, 
and it help a bit, but not completely.

My manager recommended exercising my wrists with a [spinner](https://nsdspinner.com/){:target="x"} and
doing [daily stretches](https://youtu.be/mSZWSQSSEjE){:target="x"}.
