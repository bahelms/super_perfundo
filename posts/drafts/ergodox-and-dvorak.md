Ergodox EZ and Dvorak: A typing odyssey

I got one of the most customizable keyboards around and decided, "What the hell, let's switch typing layouts entirely."
This is my story.

### The Problem

About six months ago my left wrist began to hurt. I assumed it was due to typing ~8 hours a day for many years.
It seemed to stem from the many sideways movements my left pinky needed to make to hit Shift, Control, Tab, and Escape (yes, I remapped Caps Lock, all hail Vim).
Plus there are some awkward key combinations, and the left hand generally does more work than the right.

I stand at my desk all day while working, so my hands hover over the board with only my fingertips making any contact.
This prevents any strain you would get from bending your wrists to rest them on the desk, a nice perk of standing. 
However, there were adjustments I could still make.
I moved the board farther away from my body, and put the right side on a book to
create an incline for my left hand. This allowed that hand to act more naturally, 
which helped a bit but not completely.

My manager recommended exercising my wrists with a [spinner](https://nsdspinner.com/){:target="x"} and
doing [daily stretches](https://youtu.be/mSZWSQSSEjE){:target="x"}.
After incorporating all these remedies, that sometimes dull, sometimes sharp ache persisted. 
I decided to take the nuclear option.

### Enter Ergodox EZ

I've always been a fan of mechanical keyboards.
I fondly remember pulling the key caps off of those old loud boards in computer class.
There are a few in my collection these days, and I always enjoyed discoverying new, sleek, innovative designs.
I had been drooling over the idea of a customizable split keyboard for some time, even before the wrist pain.
Whenever the time came when my wife would condone yet another board for an even more ridiculous price, I would get one.
This would be the dream board; the board to rule all other boards! 
It would sit wherever my hands wished and do whatever my fingers desired.

Of all the options available today, the [Ergodox EZ](https://ergodox-ez.com/){:target="x"}
seems to be the best split mechanical keyboard with the smallest barrier of entry (unless you have the time to build your own).
The ergonomics gained with this board are incredible.
The separate sides sit underneath your hands, wherever that may be.
The optional tilt kit accomodates the natural angle of your wrists.
The keys are in staggered linear columns. 
This takes some getting used to but feels great once you do.
Why are all keyboards not ortholinear?
Each thumb has its own group of keys, allowing them take away a lot of work from tired pinkies.

And the best part? Each key on the board can be programmed to do whatever you want it to!
This brings ultimate customizability.
But be prepared to make constant changes for a long time.
I spent a solid five weeks in flux before mostly settling on my current layout.
This is made possible by how easy it is to change config with the GUI web app.

You can set up to 32 layers, which means at the push of a button all the keys will change to whatever you've set for that layer.
You can also give layers their own backlight color or change it for individual keys.
Options exist to have a single key perform a combination of keypresses or do one thing with a single press and another when held down.
I'm only using two layers currently, one for main and the other to hold all the common symbols used for coding.
I can switch between letters and symbols without leaving the home row. :O

Keep in mind, this level of customizability combined with the linear columns takes some getting used to.
Most reviewers I read said it took them a month to recover.
Before putting my old CoolerMaster into storage, I benchmarked my typing speed at an average of 80 words per minute.
After switching to the Ergodox, my speed plummeted to 35 wpm. Ouch.
I was going to need to do some practicing.

### Enter Dvorak

The board had essentially broken me so that I could be rebuilt better, faster, and healthier.
I knew that my long friend Qwerty was holding me up from hitting rock bottom, and I became intrigued by the idea of alternative layouts.
Qwerty is afterall an outdated typing method created for a use case long since deprecated.
There must be layouts designed for better ease of use if not actual typing speed increase.
I mostly had nothing to lose at this point by picking up something new.
If ever there was time to learn a different typing layout, it was now.

I came across many alternatives in my research, but the most popular layouts appeared to be Dvorak, Colemak, and Workman.
Dvorak appealed to me the most because it was created as a ground-up rethinking of a better way to type.
The other two are geared toward making Qwerty better; they keep a lot of the same keys, including that awful bottom left row ZXCV (for strategic shortcut purposes).
I explicitly wanted to get away from that since straining played apart in my wrist pain (and I can make move Ctrl wherever I want).

Based on occurances in the English dictionary, Dvorak moves the most commonly used letters to the home row, less used letters to the top row, and least used letters to the bottom.
Punctuation and vowels are on the left side with most consonants on the right. 
This allows for more hand alternation (right, left, right, left). 
Combined with lower finger travel, this layout seemed like a great way to put less strain on my phalanges.
I did a quick learning tutorial before jumping over to Dvorak completely.
Queue rock bottom: my WPM belly flopped to 17.

It was at this point when I realized this was no longer a fun game.
For the next week or two I seriously second guessed my decision.
It was incredibly demoralizing to no longer be able to do something that I used to be good at.
In fact, now it was painful. I was surrounded by a feeling of helplessness very similar to the way I remember feeling when I first started programming.
I was a total noob again, and that's not a great feeling when you know the happiness of being experienced.
On top of this, I use Vim which meant 133t skills were crippled while editing text.
Vim was built for Qwerty, so I also had to regain muscle memory for its keyboard navigation.
I knew I would get better as long as I continued. 
I knew this was the path I wanted to go down, and as hard as it seemed, giving up now would be even worse.

I got morale boosts about every 10 WPM. I quickly reached 20. Another week and I was at 30.
Soon those rare peaks of 40 became the norm and I never dipped below 40. 
When I began to regularly hit 50 WPM, my fingers felt reborn.
Conversing digitally was no longer an exercise in frustration.
That's when I sensed that I had finally climbed the mountain I had built for myself.
And the view was pretty nice.

### Final Summation

This is where I am now. The Ergodox gives me the freedom to do whatever I want, and Dvorak lets me do it while riding an a finger cloud.
Dvorak is far superior to Qwerty, but it's not without its warts.
At first I was hesitant to go off the layout blueprint. 
But after several weeks of getting used to it, I made modfications to keys that were bothering me.
I swapped I with U, L with Z, and ' with =.
I/U seems like the big mistake of Dvorak; I shouldn't have to switch those.
This layout is the most comfortable and allows me to breeze through words with very little finger movement.
If you, dear reader, were to ever try out Dvorak, I recommend making the I/U swap from the beginning.

After the required break down and purge of my typing ego, I was able to rebuild myself from the ground up into a something that is better.
In the end, the journey has been worth it.
